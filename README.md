# PrincipleComponentAnalysis
Methodology:
We will generate a random covariance matrix for each of our 2 classes. With this matrix we will generate a dataset for each of the class, with each class having 10 attributes and 1000 rows. We then combine the data and split it into Train and Test sets. We then calculate the Eigen values and Eigen vectors of the data. Then multiply it with the training and testing data and then calculate the classification error. We then try to reconstruct the data and calculate the Mean Square Error and plot both of them in a graph.
